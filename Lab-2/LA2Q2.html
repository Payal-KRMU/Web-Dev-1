        The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and victory tower comprising the Qutb complex,
        which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs.
        It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India.It was mostly built between 1199 and 
        1220, contains 399 steps, and is one of the most-frequented heritage spots in the city. After defeating 
        Prithviraj Chauhan, the last Hindu ruler of Delhi before the Ghurid conquest of the region,
        Qutab-ud-din Aibak initiated the construction of the victory tower, but only managed to finish the first level.
        It was to mark the beginning of Islamic rule in the region. Successive dynasties of 
        the Delhi Sultanate continued the construction, and, in 1368, Firuz Shah Tughlaq rebuilt the top parts and added
        a cupola.

        Chimborazo and Cotopaxi are iconic, towering volcanoes in the Ecuadorian Andes, with Chimborazo being Ecuador's 
        highest peak (6,263m) and the point on Earth furthest from the planet's center due to the equatorial bulge. 
        Cotopaxi, at 5,897m, is Ecuador's second-highest summit and one of the highest active volcanoes in the world,
        known for its nearly perfect conical shape and active status.Both offer challenging mountaineering experiences 
        involving glacier travel and are popular for high-altitude expeditions.

    alt="Aurora Night Sky" height="350px" width="650px">
    <p>
        An aurora, or "northern/southern lights," is a natural light display in the night sky caused by charged particles
        from the sun interacting with Earth's atmosphere and magnetic field. These energetic particles, drawn toward the 
        poles, collide with atmospheric gases like oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to emit colorful light. The colors, 
        which include green, red, blue, and purple, depend on the type of gas and the altitude of the collision.
